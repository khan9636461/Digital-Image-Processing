Digital Image Processing is a foundational course focused on the analysis and manipulation of digital images 
using computational techniques. In this course, students will learn essential concepts like image representation,
color models, image enhancement, filtering, restoration, and transformation. The course explores both theoretical and practical aspects, 
teaching students how to develop algorithms that improve image quality, extract information, and perform various image processing tasks.
By the end of the course, students will have hands-on experience with tools and techniques used in fields like computer vision, 
medical imaging, and multimedia, preparing them for real-world applications and further study in advanced image processing topics.
